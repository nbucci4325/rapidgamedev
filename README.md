# Game Concept 
_Colours Make You Kill puts you in the shoes of a lone wanderer traversing through increasingly more technological and man-made landscapes, using your unique skillset to defeat hordes of cybernetically infected enemies in fast-paced hack-n-slash combat._
_The game follows a colour-based combat system where you must match the colour of your weapon to the colour of the enemy to defeat them. The plan is to have a smaller gameplay loop with an emphasis on direct stimulation which is emphasized by the hack-n-slash genre._
